## 100DEV - Here I'll be adding the solutions to the 100dev HW tasks.
## Cohort 2.


# In each folder will be a README.md with a link to progress tracker website.
    - https://communitytaught.org/class/become-a-software-engineer-for-free
    - It's an easy way to keep track of progress on the 100dev course.
    
- Also included in each README.md will be the HW for each class. I'll try to complete the optional tasks as well and submit them here.
